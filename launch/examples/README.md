These launch files are like the ones inside the `include` folder.
Each of them start a few nodes that realizes a fraction of the robot's autonomy.
Because they are not directly used in this package, they are placed in this folder named `examples`.
Feel free to copy them over to your package for further integration.
Keep in mind that you may need to modify a couple of lines in some of these snippets, to match up with your actual setup (refer to `FIXME` comments in the files).
